# WordCraft architecture

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-14 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-14 · **Change:** minor (live-agent review fixes: consent, Unix transport, safe revision identity and local checks) · **Target:** Microsoft Word (Microsoft 365) for Mac 16.113.4

How WordCraft is built today (base origin/main `159b84f` plus the live-agent implementation). The longer design notes in
`plan/architecture.md` are gitignored and local to the original author's machine; this file is the
committed, current summary. Rules for working in the code are in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## Layers

~85,600 lines of Rust, 15 crates, 3 apps and `xtask`. Layering is enforced by `cargo xtask layers`:
a crate may only depend on crates in lower layers, and nothing below L6 depends on egui, eframe,
winit or rfd.

| Layer | Crate | Lines | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | `geom` | 0.2k | Units (points, twips, EMU, inches, cm), rectangles, measurement parsing |
| L1 | `doc` | 10.0k | Document model: stories, paragraphs, runs, tables, sections, styles, numbering, fields, notes, comments, revisions, equations (OMML-shaped math tree, linear/LaTeX input); edit primitives; bidi |
| L1 | `fonts` | 2.3k | Font database (bundled OFL + system fonts), metrics, outlines, shaping with HarfRust, Word font substitution (`word.rs`: Carlito ↔ Calibri, Caladea ↔ Cambria, Liberation ↔ Arial/Times/Courier), OpenType MATH |
| L1 | `proof` | 3.8k | Proofing per language (`ProofLang` from a run's `w:lang`): English (public-domain word list) and Polish (installed Hunspell dictionary through a Hunspell-style affix engine) spelling and suggestions, rule-based grammar for both, hyphenation dictionary and Liang patterns (English, Polish) |
| L2 | `layout` | 9.6k | Shaping runs, line breaking, tabs, lists, tables (row splitting, floating tables), pagination, headers/footers, notes, floating objects and wrap, math layout, fields, hit testing; produces a display list |
| L2 | `docx` | 8.4k | OOXML WordprocessingML reader and writer (Transitional and Strict namespaces, `.docx/.docm/.dotx/.dotm`), OMML, custom properties, VBA parts preserved |
| L2 | `docbin` | 4.4k | Word 97-2003 `.doc` reader ([MS-DOC]: FIB, piece table, FKPs, SPRMs, stylesheet, lists, tables, notes, pictures) over a CFB container |
| L2 | `formats` | 10.6k | TXT, Markdown, HTML, RTF, ODT and LaTeX import/export through a shared intermediate model |
| L3 | `render` | 0.6k | vello_cpu rasteriser: pages and thumbnails from the display list; PNG/JPEG |
| L3 | `pdf` | 1.6k | krilla PDF export: font subsets, selectable text, links, outline, tagging |
| L4 | `engine` | 15.2k | `Session` (document, selection, undo, layout cache, view state), **command registry** (422 `CommandSpec`s in `cmd/*.rs`), Word feature catalog (`catalog.rs`), samples, file I/O dispatch (`io.rs`), Read Aloud sentence model |
| L4 | `zotero` | 1.7k | Zotero's word-processor integration protocol answered against a `Session` |
| L4 | `control-key` | 0.1k | Per-window control-port key files shared by the app and the MCP bridge |
| L5 | `mcp` | 1.0k | MCP server: every command as a tool; headless or bridged to the running app |
| L6 | `ui-egui` | 13.1k | Word-style front end: ribbon, keytips, mini-toolbar, Backstage, canvas, rulers, panes, dialogs, Equation tab, i18n catalogs, themes, control channel, headless `ui_shot` example |
| apps | `wordcraft` | 1.6k | Desktop app (eframe + wgpu; logging, window geometry, file associations) |
| apps | `wordcraft-cli` | 0.4k | `convert`, `text`, `inspect`, `run`, `commands`, `parity`, `mcp`, `zotero` |
| apps | `wordcraft-web` | 0.3k | Browser build (eframe web runner, WebGPU with WebGL2 fallback) |

## Data flow

1. **Open:** `engine::io` picks a reader by extension (`docx`, `docbin`, `formats`, JSON) and
   produces a `doc::Document`.
2. **Edit:** every user-visible action is a command id run through `Session::run` (ribbon,
   shortcuts, command search, CLI, control channel and MCP all dispatch by id). `Session::run`
   snapshots for undo (blocks are `Arc`-shared, so snapshots are cheap) and catches an escaped
   panic, restoring the document (never-crash standard).
3. **Layout:** `layout` turns the document into pages of positioned glyphs, boxes and images
   (display list), incrementally: an edit relayouts only what changed (1.4 ms on a 188-page
   document, measured 2026-10-06).
4. **Draw:** the UI paints pages through `render` (CPU raster, cached per page, pixel-aligned) on
   an egui/wgpu canvas; PDF export walks the same display list through `pdf`.
5. **Save:** `engine::io` picks a writer by extension.

## Testing and gates

- 821 `#[test]` functions and 10 property-test blocks: model, layout, DOCX round-trip and hostile
  input, `.doc`, formats, typing parity (`engine/src/tests_typing.rs`), bidi, i18n catalogs, UI
  interaction (egui_kittest), MCP acceptance; `hostile_params_never_panic` runs every command with
  junk params.
- `cargo xtask ci`: fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, asset attribution, layering, wasm build.
- `cargo xtask parity` regenerates [`parity-checklist.md`](parity-checklist.md); a test keeps the
  catalog percentage above a floor that only rises.
- GitHub Actions on PRs: packaging lint, and FreeBSD / Windows ARM64 when build files change;
  release builds on pushes to `release`.

## Live document agents

The desktop host owns `AgentRuntime`, independent of the legacy developer control port.
Native discovery is off until the owner explicitly enables requests in File → Options → Agents.
The saved preference is separate from Allow/Deny for each attachment. Unix uses a private filesystem socket,
Windows mutually authenticated loopback TCP with nonce/identity-bound proofs, never a raw key. Flatpak needs no new network permission. Setup exports
client-neutral configuration independently of discovery and compact optional invitations.
Unix desktop binaries provide early `--mcp-live`; Windows uses the matching sibling console CLI.
Version/probe setup is lazy and cached in a background job. A bounded asynchronous MCP initialization and `check_session` verifies the live target without
requesting attachment or reading its text.

MCP `Live` starts without a window, discovers documents and requests explicit `connect_session`.
It never creates a headless fallback. The UI enforces consent, exact document/session identity,
one agent, command restrictions and document revisions. Agent selection and editing state are
isolated; the host reserves a noncolliding tracked-change author. Mapping uses retained paragraph
identity for strict agent targeting. Ambiguous owner UI mapping relocates only the owner caret
and returns a success warning, preserving the edit; small changes map a bounded region. Revocation closes sockets and cancels queued work;
transport loss is never replayed. See [live agents](live-agents.md) and
[control protocol](control-protocol.md) for guarantees and limits.
